Check the 'Linux' subfolder for an example of a Python class definition -- this is how one can go about building a "wrapper" to meet their needs.
Although the folder is titled 'Linux', a small change will allow the code to run on Windows as well.

The content in 'Linux' has evolved into my main area of focus for different experiments, for both Windows and Linux. It is half wrapper, half testbed. Please check the content in there to get started with callng PIcam with Python. I deleted some of the older content that was stale and of poorer quality.
