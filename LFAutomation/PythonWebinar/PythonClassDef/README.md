LFAutomation contains class definitions for automation functions, which provides examples for how to load a new instance, call experiment functions, process captured data, and more
automationTest.py is a test script showing usage of the class definition.

This is a work in progress, I will update the class definitions with more useful functions and update the test script accordingly.
